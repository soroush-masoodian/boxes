Soroush Masoodian's Assignment 3 submission

part 1: fully implemented
part 2: fully implemented
part 3: fully implemented
part 4: fully implemented, but implementation has some differences from the requirements. The differences are:
- instead of the user having to hold the control button for the guide to appear on the screen, they need to press ctl+G
Reason: I was not able to figure out a way to get the amount of time that a key is held down in order to implement this with the
Timer object introduced to us in the lab.
The other requirements are implemented. Namely if, the user is in guide view mode and wants to execute a command
they just have to press the hotkey (holding control is not necessary).
